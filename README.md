# Triple Banana Filter

This is a subresource filter list for third-party browsers. This is forked from
[**Bromite filters**](https://github.com/bromite/filters), and fixes some web
site broken issues.

## Why fork rather than contributing to the Bromite?
 - To reduce data usage, we'd like to serve the filter list in compressed form.
 - We'd like to serve the filter list to third-party browsers with **different
   release cycle and policy** than Bromite.
